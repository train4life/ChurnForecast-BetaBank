# Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn for Beta Bank

Overview:
Welcome to the Predicting Customer Churn for Beta Bank project! This GitHub repository contains the code and resources to develop a model that predicts whether a customer will leave the bank soon. The goal of this project is to build a model with the maximum possible F1 score, achieve an F1 score of at least 0.59 on the test set, and measure the AUC-ROC metric to assess model performance.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to leave the bank in the near future.

Contents:

data: This directory holds the datasets used for analysis.

Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset containing clients' behavior and contract data.
Handled missing values, data types, and formatting.

Model Development:

Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
Trained the model using the training dataset.

Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using the test dataset.
Measured the F1 score and AUC-ROC metric.
Compared the performance of the two metrics.

Visualization:

Created visualizations to illustrate the distribution of F1 scores and ROC curves.
Generated charts and graphs to showcase the evaluation results.
